    <h1>Assignment for Lime</h1>
    <p>
        The mega corporation Buffel & Båg AB has a custom built system for handling meetings which has been around
        since the beginning of time and which is now deemed too hard to use. Since management doesn’t really know
        how important the system is they have invested far too little resources in the upgrade project and have
        decided to hire a single poor contractor (guess who) to solve the most important problems in almost no time.
        As a first step, management has asked for a modern, HTTP-based, API that works independently of the
        existing system and that can be called to get suggestions for suitable meeting times based on the following
        parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>participants (employee ids), one or multiple</li>
        <li>desired meeting length (minutes)</li>
        <li>earliest and latest requested meeting date and time</li>
        <li>office hours (e.g. 08-17)</li>
    </ul>
